# Titanic Problem using Logistic Pegression

## In this model, the surviours are predicted in the titanic shipwreck based on type of passengers with multiple variables as predictors

The dats is initially cleaned as there are multiple missing values. We are missing 20% of age fields. We can sometimes take the average value if there is any missing data. In this example we are imputing age based on class. We build a function where we allote some random age as if lower class it is 29, middle class 33 and so on.

The test error of the model is determined as 0.2014925

Accuracy of the model is determined 79.85075%
